I was challenge to refactor a website that was given to me and make it more use accesible.
I had to add semantic elements to make the code cleaner and easier to navigate. 
I had to make the site more user accesible by adding alt attributes to the images to allow people with impairment to be able to still view the site.
I had to consolidate the properties in the css file to make it easier to make changes.
I had to make sure the heads fell in sequential order.
I had to make sure the title was concise and descriptive.
